Yii 2 Advanced Application Template with pre-configured Paypal Integration
==========================================================================

Entire Yii2 setup with working Paypal integration. No needs for implementing specific classes. Just go on and try. You can find a sample in frontend/controllers/SiteController's index action. Under common/components/paypal you can find 3 examples:

1. express checkout

2. Print payment card details

3. Payment via Credit Debit Card

There's also a SQL-file for the Yii2 database config (paypal functionality isn't needing the database) in the paypal.sql file in the root folder of this repository.

If you have any question please do not hesitate to put an issue.
